					<h2>Okay, it's not <strong>totally</strong> free.</h2>
					<p>But if you've got CDs or vinyl that just ain't selling, you can send them to us instead. We'll add them to our pool of closeout and overstock albums, distributing them to our subscribers. We can even do coordinated packages, making sure everyone gets your albums in the same month. <strong>And we cover your shipping costs.</strong> Just tell us what you've got, and we'll work out a plan.</p>

                  <li><h3><i class="icon fa-arrow-right"></i> What do you accept?</h3>
                  <p>We strongly prefer full-length albums by single artists/bands. EPs and soundtracks are generally not preferred, full-length splits are okay. Minidiscs are right out, even we don't want that. We also will accept samplers, though only as a supplement to your main shipment. (We throw in samplers as a bonus, not one of the 10 counted CDs.) We also accept constructive criticism, and candy.</p></li>
                  <li><h3><i class="icon fa-arrow-right"></i> How does the shipping cost thing work?</h3>
                  <p>First off: if you send us albums without making an arrangement with us, they're ours. No reimbursement, they're going in the pool. (The pool of albums. We don't have a swimming pool.)</p>
                  <p>That said, if you want your albums included in a RCRDBOX, shoot us an email saying what you want to send, and how many. We'll work out the best shipping option with you, and once things are in transit, we start paying up. We reimburse incrementally; you'll have the full amount when we've received and inspected the products.</p></li>
                  <li><h3><i class="icon fa-arrow-right"></i> How many do we need to send?</h3>
                  <p>Don't try to send us 500,000. It won't count as a gold record, and we don't have that kind of space. On the other hand, it's not really worth it to send two or three. A few hundred albums in a shipment would be perfect. We can discuss a good amount based on our needs and audience at the time.</p></li>

          <p>Word from Stripe is, your subscription went through just fine. You might see a small authorization charge show up, but that'll be reversed. The real charge will happen once we've got your next box put together and sent off.</p>
          <p>Psst. <strong>By the way.</strong> We'll give you a little discount if you help us out a little bit. Just share the link below, and if anyone signs up for RCRDBOX using it, you'll get $2.50 off your next shipment. (Once they've had a successful shipment, of course.)</p>
